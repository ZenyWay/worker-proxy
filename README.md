local proxy for web worker running a given service.

# <a name="api"></a> API v1.0.0 experimental
Typescript compatible.

## example
### module: `my-service`
example of a service module.

```ts
/**
 * this is the service that will be spawned in a Worker thread
 * and that will be proxied in the main thread.
 * in this example, the service is created by a factory.
 */
export interface Service {
  process (text: string): string
}

export interface ServiceFactory {
  (spec?: Object): Promise<Service>
}

export const newService: ServiceFactory
```

### file: `worker.ts` (`WorkerGlobalScope`)
this script will be spawned from the main thread in a dedicated Worker thread.
it creates and initializes the service from the `my-service` module,
then hooks it up so that it can be proxied from the main thread.

```ts
import { extendWorker } from 'worker-proxy'
import { newService, Service } from 'my-service'

// create and initialize the service
const spec = { /* service configuration options */ }
const service = newService(spec)

// hook up the service so it can be proxied from the main thread
extendWorker(self, service)
```

### index.ts
this script proxies and spawns the `worker.ts` script
in a dedicated Worker thread.
the proxy resolves to a service object with the same interface
as that of the original service running in the Worker thread.

```ts
import { newServiceProxy } from 'worker-proxy'
import { Service } from 'my-service' // only import the interface for casting

// proxy and spawn the Worker
const proxy: Promise<Service> = newServiceProxy('./worker.ts')

// unwrap the Promise to access the service
proxy
.then(service => service.process('Hello World!'))
.then(console.log.bind(console)) // result from service.process(text) in Worker
```
